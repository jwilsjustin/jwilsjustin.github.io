      I design, build, and implement web applications. I use Ruby and Rails. And
      of course HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I love bringing design principles to
      my code.

      It's in the chairs you sit in and in the cell phone in your pocket. It's
      in the words of a book and in the art on your walls. Design isn't just
      visual. Design is everywhere.
